How the Cart Works

When a user clicks “Add to Cart”, item details are stored in localStorage

Cart page reads items from storage and displays product info

Items remain stored even after browser reload

Removing items updates storage in real-time

✅ Future Enhancements

🔸 User authentication
🔸 Payment integration
🔸 Search & filters
🔸 Admin products dashboard
